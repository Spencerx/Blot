<h2>Prevent a file becoming a post</h2>
<p> Files and folders whose name starts with an underscore are ignored. Ignored files don’t become posts but you can <a href="#files-in-your-folder-are-public">embed</a> them. For example:</p>

<table >
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <span class="icon-file"></span> _Apple.jpg
     </td>
     <td>
        Not published because the image’s name starts with an underscore.
     </td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <span class="icon-folder"></span> _Fruit
      <span class="light">›</span>
      <span class="icon-file"></span> Banana.jpg
   </td>
    <td>
        Not published because the image is in folder whose name starts with an underscore.
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <span class="icon-file-check"></span> Apple.jpg
     </td>
     <td>
        Published because images are <a href="/how/files#supported-file-types">files which Blot can publish</a>.
     </td>
    </tr>
   
  </tbody>
