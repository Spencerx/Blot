**New features**
- Blot can now extract exif data from photos, which you can use in your template, see [an example](https://chuckpearson.blog/intersection-rock-at-joshua-tree)
- You can now [publish HEIC and HEIF photos](https://blot.im/how/files/images) directly. This format is used by iPhones and now Blot converts them automatically when you add them to your folder.
- Obsidian-style media embedding is now possible. `![[image.png]]` turns into an embedded asset
- Wikilinks can now match headings on the same page. For example, `[[#Heading]]` jumps to anchored sections. [Learn more](https://blot.im/how/formatting/wikilinks).
- You can now add blockquotes to posts and pages created from [Google Docs](https://blot.im/how/files/google-docs).

**Changes**
- Blot’s source code is now [licensed under the GPL](https://blot.im/questions/3053) instead of the CC0 license.
- The Google Drive and iCloud setup flows were rewritten with new setup pages, clearer status messaging, and improved disconnect/reset reliability.
- The hosting infrastructure has been hardened with rate limiting, fail2ban automation, and new bot blocking rules to protect your site and the dashboard.
- Vimeo embeds now get full size thumbnails, as opposed to the lower resolution thumbnail previously loaded.
- Links to files in your site's folder are now delivered via our CDN, improving the performance of your site.
- Blot can now preserve single line breaks in Google Docs.
- Preload metadata is added to audio and video tags by default.
- We updated Blot’s dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities and made changes to the dashboard and documentation, per tradition.

**Bug fixes**
- YAML fenced metadata works in Google Docs.
- Images embedded using windows-style backslash paths now work.
- Bandcamp embeds render reliably again—including inside Word documents—after refining the embed parser.
- WordPress exports encode posts correctly and skip empty template files when you download an archive of your site.

**Questions**
- [Adding time or tags to photos?](https://blot.im/questions/1440)
- [What new methods of syncing a folder would you like?](https://blot.im/questions/1387)
- [What have you made with Blot?](https://blot.im/questions/1635)

**Mistakes**
- We struggled significantly with bot traffic over the summer. The silver lining was that it helped identify weak areas of the codebase which render pages on your site. We have lots of work over the next few months to make these processes faster.
- There was a major issue with subfolder syncing on iCloud drive which arose as the number of people using iCloud increased. It took too long to work out how to fix the issue, but it is now resolved.

**Plans for the winter**
- Improve the templates, especially the mobile experience.
- Improve the template editor and documentation.
