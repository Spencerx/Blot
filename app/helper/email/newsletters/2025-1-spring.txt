**New features**  
- You can now [sync your folder using iCloud](https://blot.im/how/sync/icloud).  
- Three new templates are available. Download the folders to see how Blot generates each site:  
  - [CV](https://blot.im/templates/cv) – A profile page that works well as a personal site.  
  - [Documentation](https://blot.im/templates/documentation) – A developer documentation template, also suitable for a digital garden.  
  - [Event](https://blot.im/templates/event) – A template for conferences, lectures, parties, and weddings.  
- Blot now [preserves the color profiles](https://blot.im/how/files/images#compression-and-color-profile) of images you publish, meaning you can use the P3 color space.  
- [TIFF, WEBP, and AVIF](https://blot.im/how/files/images) files now become image posts.  
- Added plugins that convert bare links to *Bluesky* and *Flickr* posts into embeds.  

**Changes**  
- Rewrote the [Google Drive](https://blot.im/how/sync/google-drive) integration to bypass new API restrictions that temporarily disrupted syncing.  
- Adjusted the Twitter embedder to support *x.com* URLs.  
- Updated dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities, as per tradition.  

**Bug fixes**  
- Resolved issues with nested objects, arrays, and tags in [YAML metadata](https://blot.im/how/metadata).  
- Fixed a bug where empty renamed files caused new posts to have incorrect dates.  
- Fixed a Markdown conversion issue that inserted extra paragraph tags.  

**Questions**  
- [How would one go about implementing Tufte CSS?](https://blot.im/questions/1449)  
- [Image gallery on an ordinary Markdown Blot page?](https://blot.im/questions/2993)  
- [Posting videos?](https://blot.im/questions/1753)  

**Mistakes**  
There were no major downtime incidents this season. However, I struggled with a persistent issue between the reverse proxy and Blot’s application server. When both upstreams were marked as bad, visitors briefly saw an error page. After much debugging, I discovered the problem—Blot’s reverse proxy was marking the application servers as offline due to a mistake I made years ago. Some ancient parts of the blog renderer were responding with incorrect HTTP error codes, causing the proxy to assume they were offline. This has now been fixed.  

**Plans for this season**  
- Considering changing Blot’s license from [CC0 to GPL](https://blot.im/questions/3053). Feel free to [share your thoughts](https://blot.im/questions/3053) or reply to this email.  
- Adding more templates. If you have any requests, please reply to this email.  
- Improving the template engine and developer documentation.  

If you have any thoughts or questions, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.  

Sincerely,  
David
